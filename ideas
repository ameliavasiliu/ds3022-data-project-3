1. Compare Commit Volume to “Author Activity Diversity”

You already computed the number of unique commit authors in the last 1000 commits.
Now show which package has the most diverse contributor base.

Example insight:

NumPy → highest contributor diversity (many small contributors)
Pandas → medium diversity (core maintainers + occassional contributors)
Plotly → extremely small contributor base → explains slow growth
Matplotlib → aging contributor base (fewer new contributors joining)

One bar chart solves this:
package vs # of unique authors (last 1000 commits)
- easy to add

----------

2. Identify “Contributor Churn”

This is extremely lightweight:
Find people who appear in PRE 6-month period but not in LAST 6 months (and vice-versa).
This lets you say:

"Pandas gained many new contributors — suggests increasing community interest."
"Matplotlib lost maintainers — consistent with slowdown."
"Plotly shows almost no churn — indicates low contributor activity overall."

One table of:
Package | # new authors | # leaving authors

----------

3. Highlight “When developers commit” (timezone patterns)
You already have hour-of-day commit graphs.

One bonus insight:
Europe-centric packages tend to peak earlier in UTC
US-centric packages peak in afternoons

Plotly may show corporate (9–5) commit patterns
Open-source academica (NumPy, SciPy) show more late-night spikes

You already computed the data — you just need to write 2–4 sentences analyzing it.
No new code needed.

----------

4. Outlier Detection

Identify months where commits spiked or crashed relative to average.
Add simple logic:
If commits > mean + 2*std → "spike”
If commits < mean - 2*std → "drop”


This lets you say things like:
“NumPy had a major spike in May due to a large refactoring PR.”
“Matplotlib’s slowdown began sharply in February.”

Even a bullet list looks impressive.

----------

5. Major Maintainer Dominance Check

Check whether a package is “single-developer heavy.”

Example output:
Pandas:
- Top contributor: 14% of commits
- Top 5 contributors: 42%

Plotly might show:
- Top contributor: 70% of commits → extremely centralized

This is a crazy strong insight because it shows if a package is fragile or healthy.
